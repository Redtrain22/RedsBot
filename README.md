# About

This bot is a personal project. I add the features I want as challenges for me or as utilities for me.

# Running the bot

## Docker

    When running the bot with docker you'll have to mount a volume that maps to `/bot/data` to backup the SQLite database and to fill out the config file.

## Baremetal

    	Install the dependancies with `npm install`. Run the bot with `npm start` and it will create the config file and database in a data directory. Please configure the config file to how you plan to setup the database.
